# vibrant-todo-app

Build a todo app. Follow the following design principles:
Use a Light Base: Employ a predominantly white or light-colored background to create a clean, expansive feel.
Accent with Vibrant Colors: Choose one or two vibrant colors for highlights, buttons, and important features to draw attention and guide user interactions.
Utilize black and grey for text for clarity.
If neccesary, design a simple, top-aligned navigation bar with clear categories, ensuring easy access and usability. Keep footer design minimal with essential links organized into categories for easy navigation.
Ample Whitespace: Utilize whitespace generously to prevent clutter, enhance content readability, and create a focus on important elements.
Hierarchical Type Setting: Use varied type sizes and weights to establish a clear visual hierarchy, helping users navigate through the content easily.
Standout CTAs: Design call-to-action buttons with standout colors that contrast with the background, making them easy to locate.
Emphasize Key Information: Use size, color, and placement to emphasize key pieces of information or actions.
